# Java

### What is Java?
Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means everything should be an object. 
### Is Java Compiled or Interpreted?
Java is both compiled and interpreted. It is first compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler (javac), then the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) interprets or JIT-compiles this bytecode to machine code at runtime.
### Is Java Strongly Typed or Loosely Typed?
Java is a strongly typed language. Variables must be explicitly declared with types, and type mismatches are caught at compile time, ensuring type safety.</br>
### Is the Java platform independent or dependent?
Java is platform-independent at the bytecode level.
Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This "write once, run anywhere" capability makes Java platform-independent. However, the JVM is platform-dependent and specific to the operating system and architecture.

IDE - It is used to write, compile and debug the code. </br>
JDK - JDK is also known as Java Development Kit; it compiles Java code.</br>
JRE - JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It's a software layer that sits on top of your operating system and provides the necessary environment for running Java programs.</br>
JVM - JVM, or Java Virtual Machine, converts bytecode to machine-specific code.</br>
